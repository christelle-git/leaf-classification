# Multiclass Leaf Classification


Goal: to categorize the leaves by tree species, based on their characteristics, that is, to determine which species of the tree the leaf belongs to.

The characteristics extracted from the images of the leaves are the margin, the shape and the texture.
The dataset contains 64 values of each features, thus the dataset is made of 3 vectors of dimension 64.

For the interested reader, the description of the dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification.

 * The present work test several models and optimize them.
 * The visualization of the results allows to determine the best performances and to select the most efficient model.
